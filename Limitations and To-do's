1. Maintenance Schedules of lines not incorporated

2. Data Consistancy across Indexes, Coef and BOM >> Develop a checker and Error Logger for that like PP

Eg: If a product Group is there it has to be related with a cutting pattern and yield for corresponding size
A few more similar cases, will exhaustively list them here soon

>> Inventory with product_group, bird_type and product_type
>> Birds available with defined size/type of bird
>> Cutting Pattern with defined sections
>> Sales order = 0 remove from the orders (will cause unnecessary increase in variables)
>>

3. A few indexes are hard coded:

SKU type >> Fresh,Frozen
customer Priorities >> 1,2
Marination >> 1,0
Process >> cutting,marination,freezing

>> Yet to check if they can be generalized or not

4. Object exchange between files is on key values >> Not good for quality, Idea: Define a custom class that will handle the input

5. Alternate Possibilities of Cost and Capacity Parameters(Need to think how to incorporte)

6. Inventory Ageing only for fresh SKU

7. Scenario objectives are predefined. Not flexible

8. As of date (17 Jul 2018), Frozen SKU's are not subjected to marination

9. Demand is available at customer SKU level

10. Capacity Measurement >>
      Freezing Capacity: kgph
      Marination Capacity: kgph
      Cutting Capacity : Number of carcasses per hour

11. Cost Measurement >>
      selling price : customer vs sku
      cutting cost : cost of cutting per carcass or per cut
      freezing cost : cost of freezing per kg
      marination cost : cost of marination per kg

12. Maximum 99 types of distinct bird sizes (not ranges, only types)
