- Inventory optimization for a general process which inherently produces byproducts.
- Byproducts at times may be expensive to store in perishable product types in food processing, meat packaging, chemical/pharmaceuticals, etc.  
- In these cases 100% demand satisfaction may not be the most optimal choice of production plan. A trade off needs to be decided between achieving profits by 100% demand satisfaction and at the same time incurring storage costs. 
- Optimization problems like this are also known as Imbalance Parts optimization
