              (Note that: Product group can be extracted from a uniue set
               eg: A product_group that is extracted from section 1 cannot be yielded by section 2)

8. Sales Order:
    The orders placed within the planning horizon, available at the customer sku level
    The open orders table from the ERP is expected to be in the given format
    An order placed can be inform of count of SKUs or total weight of SKUs

    order_weight: Quantity of Order in form of number of units

    (Note: It is not necessary to place order in both the UOM's either of the one will suffice the requirement, Conversion factor(avg) is available using the yield data)

9. Section:
    The distinct sections of bird for cutting pattern, yield and product group definition
    The sections are exclusive of each other (Do not share any part of the bird)

    key: section_index
