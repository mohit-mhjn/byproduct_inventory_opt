1. Maintenance Schedules of lines not incorporated

2. Data Consistancy across Indexes, Coef and BOM >> Develop a checker and Error Logger for that like PP

Eg: If a product Group is there it has to be related with a cutting pattern and yield for corresponding size
A few more similar cases, will list them here soon

3. A few indexes are hard coded:

SKU type >> Fresh,Frozen
customer Priorities >> 1,2
Marination >> 1,0
Process >> cutting,marination,freezing

>> Yet to check if they can be generalized or not

4. Object exchange between files is on key values >> Not good for quality, Idea: Define a custom class that will handle the input

5. Alternate Possibilities of Cost and Capacity Parameters(Need to think how to incorporte)
